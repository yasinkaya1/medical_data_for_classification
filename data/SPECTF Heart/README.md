# SaHeart Dataset
This data is collected from UCI Repository.

In the original dataset, column 'OVERALL_DIAGNOSIS' is found as the first column. We have moved this column to the end here. 
After that we put headers (e.g., F1, F2, F3 etc.) as ordered here. For example, F1 is the first feature ( i.e., 'F1R:   continuous (count in ROI (region of interest) 1 in rest)'), F2 is the sconde feature (i.e., 'F1S:   continuous (count in ROI 1 in stress)'), F3 is the third feature (i.e., 'F2R:   continuous (count in ROI 2 in rest)') etc.
