# PlanningRelax Dataset
This data is collected from UCI Repository. 

In the original dataset, there is no headers. We put headers (e.g., F1, F2, F3 etc.) as ordered here. For example, F1 is the first feature ( i.e., '1st wavelet coefficient in the 7-13 Hz frequency'), F2 is the sconde feature (i.e., '2nd wavelet coefficient in the 7-13 Hz frequency') etc.
