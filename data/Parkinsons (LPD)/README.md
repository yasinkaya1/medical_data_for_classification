# Parkinsons Dataset
This data is collected from UCI Repository. 

In the original dataset, the first column is 'name' and there is a 'status' column in the middle. We have removed the values of the 'name' column and moved 'status' column to the end.
After that we put headers (e.g., F1, F2, F3 etc.) as ordered here. For example, F1 is the first feature ( i.e., 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)'), F2 is the sconde feature (i.e., 'MDVP:Fhi(Hz)'), F17 is the 17th feature (i.e., 'RPDE') etc.
