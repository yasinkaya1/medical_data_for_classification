# HCC Dataset
This data is collected from UCI Repository. 

In the original data there is no header. We put headers (e.g., F1, F2, F3 etc.) as ordered here. For example, F1 is the first feature ( i.e., 'Gender'), F2 is the sconde feature (i.e., 'Symptoms'), F3 is the third feature (i.e., 'Alcohol') etc.
