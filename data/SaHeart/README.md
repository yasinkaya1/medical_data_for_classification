# SaHeart Dataset
This data is collected from https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn//datasets/SAheart.data 

In the original dataset, column 'row.names' is found as the first column. We have removed the values of the column 'row.names'. 
After that we put headers (e.g., F1, F2, F3 etc.) as ordered here. For example, F1 is the first feature ( i.e., 'sbp'), F2 is the sconde feature (i.e., 'tobacco'), F3 is the third feature (i.e., 'ldl') etc.
